# Project Instructions

This course project is an opportunity to independently demonstrate mastery of course material on an NLP problem that you find interesting. Your project will be structured similarly to an academic paper. Your must submit the final project as a paper along with a notebook file to the `project` folder of your GitHub repositiory by the end of the semester.

## 1. Data Collection

Develop a NLP-related research question that you want to answer, and collect a text data set that you will use to answer your research question. Here, you should have:

1. A well-represented research question
2. A dataset to use to answer the question (EDGAR 10-K item 1A or item 7)
3. A python notebook with preliminary exploration of data and its characteristics
4. A draft introductory section of your paper

## 2. Model Development

Develop a model to answer the research question you posed in the first part of the project. Here, you should have:

1. A data pre-processing pipeline
2. A trained model
3. A Python notebook you used to pre-process, train, and assess your model
4. A draft of your final paper's Methods section.

## 3. Compare against baselines

Compare your method against an alternative approach and discuss the pros and cons of your approach compared to the baseline. Here, you should have:

1. One or more figures/tables describing the results of the method for the experiment.
2. A python notebook comparing the baseline method to your approach.
3. A draft results section of the final paper.

## 4. Complete the paper

Generate visualizations that illustrate the pros and cons of your approach, and discuss future directions of the work. Here, you should have:

1. A final report with a discussion section
2. A well organized code repository that allows one to regenerate all the results described in your report

## 5. Submit

Submit the final project as a paper along with a notebook file to the `project` folder of your GitHub repositiory by the end of the semester.
